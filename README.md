Rule-Based Sports Chatbot
Description:
This repository contains a rule-based chatbot that engages users in sports-related conversations. The chatbot uses predefined patterns and if-else logic to understand and respond to user queries about their favorite sports, teams, athletes, and more. It is designed to demonstrate basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using regular expressions and rule-based intent matching.

Features:
Pattern Matching: Detects user intent based on regular expressions, allowing for natural conversation flow.
Sports-Focused: Engages users on topics like their favorite sport, team, last game watched, and more.
Randomized Responses: Provides dynamic responses to keep conversations interesting.
Exit Command Handling: Recognizes when the user wants to exit the chat.
Simple & Lightweight: A great starting point for understanding rule-based chatbots.
How It Works:
The bot starts by greeting the user and asking if they are willing to chat about sports.
Based on user input, the bot identifies the intent (e.g., favorite sport, team, athlete) and responds accordingly.
If no match is found for the input, the bot will ask the user to elaborate or provide a general response.
Users can end the chat anytime using exit commands like "quit" or "bye."
Future Enhancements:
Adding memory to personalize conversations based on past interactions.
Expanding the scope to include specific sports leagues, teams, or tournaments.
Incorporating sentiment analysis for more empathetic responses.
Technologies Used:
Python
Regular Expressions (Regex) for pattern matching
Basic NLP techniques
